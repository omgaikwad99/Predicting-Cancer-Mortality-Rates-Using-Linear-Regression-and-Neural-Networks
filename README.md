The model is trained using the cancer_reg.csv dataset which is available on this repo.
There is a single Jupyter notebook containing all the different models with different learning rates in different snippets. You just need to run different snippets for the whole process.
I was using Google Colab to code for this assignment, which is why the code to import the cancer_reg.csv file is a little different. You may need to modify the first snippet depending on what platform you are using to import the CSV file.
